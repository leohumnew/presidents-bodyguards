# River Problem: Presidents and bodyguards
A Python program to solve the president/bodyguard version of the river problem, as explained below. Customizable number of couples and boat capacity (WIP).

# Explanation
X number of presidents and their bodyguards need to cross a river. The sole means by which to do this is a 
boat that will carry only 2 people. When 2 people cross the river, if anyone is still on the other 
side, someone needs to row the boat back across so that more or other people can cross the river 
too.

So long as a president is accompanied by their bodyguard, they are safe. Any unaccompanied 
president in the presence of other bodyguards will be assassinated. No bodyguard or number of 
bodyguards will attack another president so long as that president is with their own bodyguard. 
Bodyguards will not assassinate each other nor will presidents assassinate another president.
A president in the boat is safe from other bodyguards so long as they remain in the boat and the 
bodyguards are on the shore.
